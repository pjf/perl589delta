	     Change 28404 broke the construct s/foo/<<BAR/e. So, try to be more
	     clever. If the right hand side of s///e contains a #, then maybe
	     it's a comment, so add a \n after it. Obviously, this is fast, but
	     won't cover all possible cases.

	     Calling cv_undef() on the CV created by newCONSTSUB() would leak like
	     a Jumblie's preferred maritime craft. To free CvFILE for this case,
	     take advantage of the 0 length prototype that will also be there,
	     and hang it from the prototype. To do this properly means changing
	     code to actually pay attention to SvCUR() on prototypes. It turns out
	     that we always know the length of the prototype string, so this may
	     be faster. Certainly, it's a memory saving (even ignoring the leak).

	     Subject: arena-rework : consolidated patch
	     From: Jim Cromie <jim.cromie@gmail.com>
	     Message-ID: <43F0F649.9040205@gmail.com>
	     Date: Mon, 13 Feb 2006 14:12:41 -0700
	     
	     Tweaked somewhat to split the arena boolean from the arena_size,
	     and with the PTE still doubling-up with one of the SV types in the
	     array.
	     
	     [ 27290]
	     Using U8 rather than size type shrinks the body_details table.
	     
	     [ 27291]
	     Shrink struct body_details and hence sv.o slightly further by using
	     bitfields.
	     
	     [ 27292]
	     We have sufficient spare bits to store the SV type in body_details,
	     so add a small sanity check to ensure that we have the array in the
	     correct order.
	     
	     [ 27338]
	     Workaround for initialization errors on HP's pre-compiler
	     Do not ask me to explain. This re-definition works on AIX
	     and HP-UX. Let's await the smokes.
	     
	     [ 27405]
	     Remove the #define - ARENASETS are always on now.
	     
	     [ 29878]
	     Move C<static bool done_sanity_check;> inside the only function that
	     uses it.
	     
	     [ 29879]
	     As Perl_get_arena() is dealing with sizes, use size_t rather than int,
	     as it's both unsigned and semantically the correct width for a size.
	     As all arenas get cleared later on, can use Newx() rather than Newxz().
	     
	     [ 29881]
	     I think that it's clearer if aroot is only struct arena_set *
	     (rather than ** and constantly dereferneced). Move the declaration
	     of new_root into the block it is used in. Add a comment describing
	     where the arenas for arena_sets themselves aren't rooted anywhere.
	     
	     [ 29882]
	     Add a parameter to Perl_get_arena() to pass in the SV type, and record
	     this in the arena description. Change all sizes to unsigned values.
	     Make Perl_sv_free_arenas() loop downwards to free memory, simplifying
	     the logic. Remove my erroneous comment added in change 29881.

	     It's actually easier to get rid of PL_fdscript than we thought.
	     
	     [ 27068]
	     Oops. I *thought* that I had checked that all changed files were open.
	     Clearly not. (Fixes change 27066)
	     
	     [ 27069]
	     Passing the flag to S_forbit_setid as a single char rather than a
	     string is a slight space optimisation.
	     
	     [ 27070]
	     Eliminating PL_suidscript is more tricky, and requires changing the
	     prototype of Perl_moreswitches.
	     
	     [ 27072]
	     Change 27070 failed to initialise a variable. (But despite that still
	     passed all tests locally.)
	     
	     [ 27073]
	     Pull the variables fdscript and suidscript into a much smaller scope.
	     Replace suidscript with literal -1 where it could only have been -1.
	     (Re-indent the other code inside the new block creating the scope.
	     Rejig the indentation of the conditionals)
	     
	     [ 27074]
	     The MSDOS-only call to moreswitches will never reach forbid_setid, so
	     it can have a parameter of -1 without changing any behaviour.
	     I see no reason to forbid "command line" switches when they are
	     actually coming from the #! line of the script itself (as read by perl)
	     as they must have been written by the owner of the script, rather than
	     being crafted by the user manipulating the command line, and therefore
	     cannot be subverted. (Or alternatively, can be subverted as easily as
	     the rest of the script, and we're permitting *that* to be run)
	     
	     [ 27075]
	     And as we've now got to the point where all calls to Perl_moreswitches
	     have -1 as the second argument, we can remove the second argument,
	     which gets us back to where we started, only with the elimination of
	     a per-thread variable.
	     
	     [ 27076]
	     S_find_beginning is only called from one place, so by hoisting the
	     forbid_setid check for -x into the caller, we can eliminate the
	     suidscript parameter from S_find_beginning.
	     
	     [ 27077]
	     Remove obsolete comment.
