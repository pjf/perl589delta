	     Removing MAKE_JOBS_FIFO from %ENV causes FreeBSD make to forget about
	     any -j flags. (And their implied disabling of backwards compatibility,
	     which is the real cause of the make disttest failure).

	     When MAN3PODS is forced to {} in a Makefile.PL, manpages should not be
	     built from pods. This change fixes bleadperl compilation -- trying to
	     build manpages with miniperl causes a bootstrapping problem.
	     
	     [ 27708]
	     Change 27592 disabled the building of manpages for non core-extensions
	     The init_MAN3PODS method need to be called when no INSTALLMAN3DIR is
	     present in the first place.

	     Make the ptr_table functions available in an unthreaded perl, as other
	     code (such as Storable) can take advantage of them.

	     The last parameter to gv_stashpv/gv_stashpvn/gv_stashsv is a bitmask
	     of flags, not a boolean, so correct the documenation and callers.

	     One last gv_fetchpv() that should be GV_ADD rather than TRUE.

	     newPADOP()'s sv parameter is never NULL, so mark it as so.
	     (Well, in theory it could be NULL if someone is creating ops during
	     symbol table destruction, but snowballs in hell, etc.
	     This is usually the point where Jarkko observes that the aliens are
	     looking for a free slot in their diaries...)
	     
	     [ 30043]
	     Change 30034 wasn't enough to silence the warnings - also need to
	     pass a never-NULL parameter to newPADOP from newGVOP
