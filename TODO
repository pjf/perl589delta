* Double-check B version number before final release -- PJF
* in 2006-10.txt, chage 29129 integrates 26400, '[PATCH] latest switch/say/~~'
  which doesn't make sense to me (switch/say/~~ is not in 5.8.9). Please
  re-check. --moritz
  * Nicholas Clark: "it's there because B is (notionally) dual life,
    so the B code is the same in all branches", he also stated it wasn't hugely
    noteworthy to include, but maybe this should be decided when 5.8.9 is
    released (p30363) --aflott
* I guess change 28879 (integrated in 30048) could be interesting, but so far
  I couldn't figure out what it actually does. --moritz
* Change 30046 integrates 'Subject: [perl #40239] New hints file for
  MidnightBSD'  which I don't know where to add. --moritz
* 29759 integrates 25953, which introduces a new header file. Should that be
  mentioned somehow? --moritz
* Don't know if and how 29721 -> 29138 should be mentioned --moritz
* Check that all the upgraded modules are actually correct -- PJF
* The optimized constant subs are in the source, but not used by 
  constant.pm (from NC) (p30355) --aflott
* Are ptar and ptardiff really out? They are in 5.10.0 --aflott
* 29609 says "Upgrade to Text::Balanced 2.0.0" and doesn't seem to get
  reverted later on, but lib/Text/Balanced.pm says it's 1.98 --moritz
* Make sure that Spiros' name is entered correctly in the AUTHORS
  file.
* In 2007-11-i.txt, changes 31860, 31882, and 31885 seems to deal with "say"
  which I'm not sure it's true (see comments above in 2006-10.txt by morits 
  and aflott) -- eddy
* Changes 31964, 31986, 31988, and 31992 deal with OptreeCheck.pm and its tests
  but I have no idea what that is -- eddy 
* Not sure what essential change in 32164 and 32177 -- eddy
* Change 31863 and 31887 is just another addition in perltodo, but not sure how
  to include them in the delta -- eddy
* 30224 was a lot of work on perlrun.pod but also has extra stuff I could
  not translate into anything useful - specifically 28528, 28578, 29168,
  29299, 29358 and 29544.
* Unsure what to do with 30237 which contains 28870, 28982, 29778.
  Similarly 30232 (27228, 29669), 30230 (26799), 30227 (28715), 
  30225 (28238), 30223 (30183, 30218),  30222 (30087, 30129), 
  30209 ( 29593,29594, 29659,30010), 30208 (28513)
