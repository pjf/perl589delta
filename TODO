* Double-check B version number before final release -- PJF
* in 2006-10.txt, chage 29129 integrates 26400, '[PATCH] latest switch/say/~~'
  which doesn't make sense to me (switch/say/~~ is not in 5.8.9). Please
  re-check. --moritz
* I guess change 28879 (integrated in 30048) could be interesting, but so far
  I couldn't figure out what it actually does. --moritz
* Change 30046 integrates 'Subject: [perl #40239] New hints file for
  MidnightBSD'  which I don't know where to add. --moritz
* 29759 integrates 25953, which introduces a new header file. Should that be
  mentioned somehow? --moritz
* Don't know if and how 29721 -> 29138 should be mentioned --moritz
* Check that all the upgraded modules are actually correct -- PJF
